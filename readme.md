# Zip Code Location Search API

## Problem Statement

Planning activities is not always easy, especially if one does not know whether the weather will cooperate.

## Solution

The Zip Code Location Search API provides a simple, user-friendly interface that allows the user to enter a zip code, a radius around that zip code, and a type of places of interest (POIs) to search for, and returns a list of the designated POIs within the user-specified area.  It also returns weather information for each of them.
