# Zip Code Location Search API

## Problem Statement

Finding the nearest location for a particular good or service is not always easy,
even in today's world.  Most maps will display everything in a specific location,
demarcating them by geography rather than utility.

## Solution

The Zip Code Location Search API provides a simple,
user-friendly interface that allows the user to enter two pieces of data: a zip code,
and a type of good or service to search for within that zip code.  It will then return the locations of 3-5
examples of that good or service within the given zip code.
